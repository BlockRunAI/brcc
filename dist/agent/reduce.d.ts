/**
 * Token Reduction for runcode.
 * Original implementation — reduces context size through intelligent pruning.
 *
 * Strategy: instead of compression/encoding, we PRUNE redundant content.
 * The model doesn't need verbose tool outputs from 20 turns ago.
 *
 * Three reduction passes:
 * 1. Tool result aging — progressively shorten old tool results
 * 2. Whitespace normalization — remove excessive blank lines and indentation
 * 3. Stale context removal — drop system info that's been superseded
 */

 * Progressively shorten tool results based on age.

 *
 * This is the biggest token saver — a 10KB bash output from 20 turns ago
 * can be reduced to "✓ Bash: ran npm test (exit 0)" saving ~2500 tokens.
