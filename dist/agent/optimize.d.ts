 * Token optimization strategies for 0xcode.

 * 1. Tool result size budgeting — cap large outputs, keep preview
 * 2. Thinking block stripping — remove old thinking from history
 * 3. Time-based cleanup — clear stale tool results after idle gap
 * 4. Adaptive max_tokens — start low (8K), escalate on hit
 * 5. Pre-compact stripping — remove images/docs before summarization
